- Please review existing issues (including closed ones) before posting a new one
- Please fill in this template according to your issue
- Please use actual versions, e.g. versions copied from `composer show`
- If you need support, e.g. you cannot make your file upload work, you
  need to provide a way to easily reproduce it. Best way is a repository
  with a basi installation of Symfony, VichUploaderBundle and your code
-->
